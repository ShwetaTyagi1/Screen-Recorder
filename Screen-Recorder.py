    try-finally Block: The try block contains the code that might raise exceptions, such as errors during video frame capture or writing. The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs, ensuring that the output.release() line is always executed, even if an error happens.
    output.release(): This line closes the video writer, saving the final video file and releasing the associated resources. Placing it within the finally block guarantees its execution, preventing incomplete or corrupted files.
